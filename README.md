**Project**


#This research project focuses on improving the tracking of individual broiler chickens in a group setting using multi-object tracking computer vision algorithms. Despite advancements, existing algorithms struggle with identity switches and reduced tracking efficiency due to challenges such as similar bird appearances and environmental changes. This study introduces a refined tracking system that incorporates the YOLOv11x model enhanced with a custom feature extractor and a kinematics-aware machine learning classifier. Our system significantly improves tracking accuracy, precision, and processing speeds by optimizing model parameters and integrating advanced machine learning techniques.

**Key Findings**

##Performance: The YOLOv11x model, with custom modifications and pruning, achieved high precision and recall across various developmental stages of broilers.

##Efficiency: Model pruning increased processing speeds without compromising detection performance, handling real-time tracking requirements effectively.

##Re-identification Improvements: Enhanced feature extraction techniques resulted in better re-identification of individual birds, crucial for long-duration tracking.

##Kinematic Features: Integration of kinematic features with a machine learning classifier minimized identity switches, enhancing the overall consistency of the tracking system.

##Conclusion: The developed system not only advances the technology in precision poultry farming but also sets a foundation for more robust and efficient animal tracking solutions in diverse farming environments.
